Tabu Search: A combinatorial optimization for chemical synthesis

The main repository for this code is in https://github.com/alexfrt/tabu. I implemented the interfaces so it can work for the chemical synthesis project. 

Summary:
This optimization is called TabuSearch optimization strategy and it is a combinatorial optimization.

To Run Optimization:
run RunOptimization.java

TODO:
- Import building blocks (array list of molecules. Empty method in TabuSearch.java)
- Define objective function (Will be implemented in getValue() of ChemSynSolution.java)
- Test smirks
